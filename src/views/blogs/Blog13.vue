      The Untold Wonders of Deflationary Economics
    </h1>

    <p style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
    <p>
      In the beginning, God created Man and Woman. And two Economic Systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Inflationary System (IS) that rides on the power behind making the
      starving majority envy the ultra rich, and the Deflationary System (DS)
      that rides on the power behind making the necessities of life cheaper so
      that, like Elon Musk, many more can have babies with neither worry nor
      sorry. And enjoy the love and joy of a big family with true financial
      security.
    </p>
    <p>Security not from thieves, but the harshness of nature.</p>
    <p>
      Here are examples of the differences between how the two systems see the
      world.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>1. Housing</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p>If the price of the average house rockets up;</p>
    <p>
      <em>IS:</em> Congrats. The homeowner just registered increased value on
      their house. As so many houses of its type exist, people must be getting
      richer. Wow!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <em>DS:</em> Oh noo. Money was printed and given to rich people as
      interest free credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they are buying up all the homes in a rush which is pushing up prices.
    </p>
    <p>Where will the poor commoner sleep?</p>
    <p>They will be enslaved to rent forever!</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>2. Smartphones</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <em>IS:</em> Smartphones are getting cheaper by the year. We need to keep
      them expensive by making them fail quickly via planned obsolescence.
    </p>
    <p>Coz where shall companies get money if a product lasts forever?</p>
    <p>Indeed there is a thing as too much innovation.</p>
    <br />
    <p><em>DS:</em> Yes, more utility in a smart phone and it is cheaper!</p>
    <p>Yeah baby.</p>
    <p>
      The companies whose business model is to sell great computers and
      smartphones need to level up now.
    </p>
    <p>Selling hardware is so outmoded.</p>
    <p>
      Whoever realises that the money is now in customer information as they use
      digital products, hence leading to more effective targeted advertising, is
      going to run this joint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wait, Google has done this. Apple, Microsoft, YouTube. AirBnB, Amazon,
      Alibaba.
    </p>
    <p>Free things. But not really free. Very Interesting don't you think.</p>
    <p>Very exciting too.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>3. Land</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <em>IS:</em> It's obvious, more human beings = increasing prices for land.
    </p>
    <p>Coz the Earth is finite. Deal with it.</p>
    <p>Guess Malthus was right all along. There are too many babies on here.</p>
    <p>
      That majority won't be able to afford their own slice on earth is just
      unfortunate.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the rich shall inherit the Earth.</p>
    <p>It is evolution. Isn't that what the DS believers say.</p>
    <p>The apex predator rules the jungle.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <em>DS:</em> Any country with cheap energy sources without plans on how to
      get some skyscrapers going is really not thinking. They are frozen in the
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      10 floors on a building = 10 times the land area, which makes land cheaper
      if we are thinking floor space, but now there is also an increase in
      utility.
    </p>
    <p>Remember, Cheaper but More Utility is our motto.</p>
    <p>
      Redefining land as floor space is the future. Somebody contact Urban
      dictionary.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>4. Money</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <em>IS:</em> Do not say Bitcoin. That worthless thing one cannot even
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>I mean, people being their own banks??</p>
    <p>Haha. It will never work.</p>
    <p>Too complex.</p>
    <p>Too polluting.</p>
    <p>Too pyramid schemey (Oops. Sorry).</p>
    <br />
    <p><em>DS:</em> Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>
      Because with Bitcoin, nothing else needs to store economic value by
      registering a price increase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything else gets cheaper, while Bitcoin price-value rockets up to the
      moon. Then to Mars.
    </p>
    <p>The balance sheet is indeed finally balanced forever.</p>
    <p>Asset (Store of Value) = Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>
      Liabilities (Goods and Services that provide value to Assets) = Everything
      else.
    </p>
    <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;infinity/21M&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
    <p>What a meme.</p>
    <br />
    <p><strong>5. *Energy*</strong></p>
    <br />
    <p><em>IS:</em> DS get over here</p>
    <p><em>DS:</em> Yes.</p>
    <p>
      <em>IS:</em> You know it is not good for individuals to run their own
      energy power plants. You know this right?
    </p>
    <p><em>DS:</em> Says who?</p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> Says common sense.</p>
    <p>(They look at each other while their eyes say 'Chernobyl' )</p>
    <p><em>DS:</em> Ok. So who should run it.</p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> Government of course.</p>
    <p>
      <em>DS:</em> But governments believe in making a budget after spending.
      They are wasteful.
    </p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> They can learn. Be patient.</p>
    <p>
      <em>DS:</em> When exactly will they learn that energy is the King resource
      and it should not be messed with?
    </p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> No choice. They must control the energy.</p>
    <p>
      <em>DS:</em> Oh but there is a choice. More efficiency minded individuals
      can group together into a successful legal entity called a
      corporation.You've heard of it.
    </p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> Still under government control.</p>
    <p><em>DS:</em> Yes and No.</p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> Talk about the Yes.</p>
    <p><em>DS:</em> Only as long as the government is a functioning entity.</p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> Else?</p>
    <p>
      <em>DS:</em> The DS believers will be voted into the governments of the
      future. And they are growing and you know it.
    </p>
    <p><em>IS:</em> Well...</p>
    <p><em>DS:</em> Well?</p>
