    <h1>Bitcoin – Gold version 2.0</h1>
    <h3>by Maali Marvin</h3>
    <p>Let us travel back in time to 1022 years ago.</p>
    <p>We are now in a cave.</p>
    <p>A dungeon actually.</p>
    <p>
      Inside this dungeon lives a man, not a dragon. And he breathes fire
      constantly to boil some concoction or other in a large pot using an
      equally large set of bellows.
    </p>
    <p>Foooo. Foooo.</p>
    <p>
      Looking closely, we see the man looks haggard with anticipation. Whatever
      he is boiling seems to be so important his eyes are opened wide in
      wholesome excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog in the corner is not so sure however. As evidenced by its look of
      concern over its owner’s health. He never takes a break even to bathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this time round, he is certain, he has managed to turn some profound
      mixture of eggs, soil, weird plants and herbs into gold.
    </p>
    <p>Friend, this man is what is called an Alchemist.</p>
    <p>
      Alas, we cannot warn his of his demise. His absolute failure to find the
      philosopher’s stone in his boilings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dying having accomplished nothing like the transmutation he seeks. Like
      the rest of his fast-getting-extinct kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is fate that he lives out his life like this. Coz only then shall we
      have chemistry later on.
    </p>
    <p>We cannot mess up with the timeline. We can only watch. And learn.</p>
    <p>Why? Why are these men obsessed with gold?</p>
    <p>Well, gold is a very big deal in 1000AD.</p>
    <p>Has been so since 5000 BC and will continue to be so.</p>
    <p>
      The reason for this is a sweet tale of its own but the short summary is
      this. Gold is beautifully yellow and indestructible. And independently,
      all the peoples of the world from the Chinese to Indians to Arabs have
      seen the light and now use it as money atop of having it as jewellery,
      cutlery.
    </p>
    <p>It is the hardest money of the times. And the raddest.</p>
    <p>
      So the Alchemists in the caves are trying to get rich. They may look like
      a cross between distraught monks and over-worked coal miners but they are
      not looking for God in their pots.
    </p>
    <p>Say, they are fuelled by greed.</p>
    <p>
      In a way, they are like hackers trying to inflate the amount of Bitcoin we
      have today.
    </p>
    <p>
      False tales of increasing the gold supply without physically mining it
      from the ground, but using ‘magic’, had spread so well that some men
      devoted their entire lives to doing just this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hype got so big some Alchemists actually are looking for mystical
      powers alongside gold.
    </p>
    <p>Call them stupid, they invented chemistry. Bless their souls.</p>
    <p>
      (Wonder what hackers trying to break Bitcoin today will invent. Better
      decryption tech probably. Which has a lot of real world uses in
      mathematical problem solving.
    </p>
    <p>No. They will not create some Bitcoin for themselves).</p>
    <p>
      The mania for gold became so complete we got to have people called Pirates
      who hodled gold so hard they buried it in places nobody could find. Hence
      birthing the wonderful niche industry of treasure hunting.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we got this brazen group of murderous explorers called the
      conquistadors that made the continent of South America known to Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence helping make the world a global village. While they killed innocent
      locals with their deadly guns and European diseases to which only they
      were immune.
    </p>
    <p>Indeed, sad tales litter the past.</p>
    <p>
      A story goes that when the Aztec and Mayan peoples asked these men why
      they loved gold (even the Mayans and Aztecs already knew about gold.
      Surprised?!) so much they went bonkers over it, they replied honestly that
      they had this weird disease of the heart that could only be cured by gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      All their lives, they had grown up using gold as currency/an
      investment-by-saving instrument/jewellery whose value and market price and
      aesthetic value only soared higher and higher. Like an Eagle.
    </p>
    <p>So much so that it made people live boldly to acquire some gold.</p>
    <p>
      Some crossed oceans on dhows that only depended on seasonal winds to move.
      Imagine that.
    </p>
    <p>Others wrote epic tales like the story of King Midas.</p>
    <p>Alchemists who believed in witchcraft went and invented chemistry.</p>
    <p>
      And artists like Michelangelo earned so handsomely they could hang upside
      down everyday for months, painting wondrous divine images on the ceiling
      of the Sistine Chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gold was and is so supreme even every Emperor respected eating with golden
      cutlery, being paid in gold coins (unclipped mind you. Or off goes your
      head), having golden tables.
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <p>
      Because with gold, you could command an army of 10,000 strangers to go
      look all over the world for the best doctors, engineers, artists and bring
      them into your service..
    </p>
    <p>As long as you are paying in gold.</p>
    <p>--------</p>
    <p>That was the tale of old gold.</p>
    <p>Back to 2022.</p>
    <p>June.</p>
    <p>
      Just so you know, gold is NOT what did things. It was the energy that
      people, like you and me, used to build, design, think, create a better
      world. And the energy that we found how to put to good use through
      heavy-lifting machines and information machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The overflowing love for gold in the past was simply because gold helped
      everyone achieve economic efficiency by focussing their attention on
      getting rich in terms of gold. Where before they ran around focussing on
      hundreds of things they do not care about such as “The price of Chinese
      herbal tea with respect to a Ugandan lemon”
    </p>
    <p>Jesus.</p>
    <p>Barter trade was a mess indeed.</p>
    <p>
      But gold is hard to carry around due its incredible weight and carrying
      anything consumes energy. Physics 101.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gold is hard to keep track of to know who owns what in transaction records
      (Say you are working for the Medici bank in the 1400s. The records could
      be eaten by rats, you could enter them incorrectly, they could be burnt
      when Crusader bandits go through your city of Florence). No wonder banks
      emerged to astounding heights of power. Coz keeping good records of
      transactions is exhausting and also energy consuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      That we live in nations ruled by governments today, if you own gold it can
      easily be confiscated by the government for the sake of the national good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully, a mysterious person called Satoshi Nakamoto created us
      Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>Gold version 2.0</p>
    <p>
      Unlike the old gold, BTC is easier to keep hidden so thieves will have a
      hard time stealing it, is easier to move around so much so that you can
      send some from Europe to South America in a few minutes, and is easier to
      verify transactions of its really scarce coins that it will only be
      trusted more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite you needing to trust no one on the Bitcoin blockchain except the
      fact that they also want to get rich. Like you J
    </p>
    <p>
      AND – It is built on the energy I just told you about. The thing that
      actually does anything. The ability to do work as every Physicist knows.
    </p>
    <p>-----------</p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is the beginning of human apotheosis to something truly uniting
      and empowering to the average Joe. It is a small step to realise the
      dreams of Adam Smith and Karl Max. Financially empowered good workers who
      can then use their economic value to create even more economic value.
      Sidestepping periods of inflationary mania as orchestrated by fiat-ish
      scammers with sometimes good intentions e.g. “Give me all you money for
      this fiat token of mine that does blah blah so that I solve climate change
      for you”.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Bitcoin we hope for abundance of goodies and deflation. Instead of
      artificial scarcity of goodies and inflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if governments had never gone off the gold standard, Bitcoin was an
      inevitable invention for a digital world. Like the engine was inevitable
      once people realised that energy could move things e.g. the lid atop a
      kettle of boiling water.
    </p>
    <p>Yes, there is a chance it could fail. Maybe 1%, maybe 0.00000001%.</p>
    <p>It could come from true energy-infrastructure scarcity.</p>
    <p>
      BUT it will be rediscovered again. Just like the awesome ideas of
      Aristotle were rediscovered so as to ignite the renaissance in Europe in
      the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be named something new as well. Maybe “Mesh-Energy” or something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though once it successfully tethers to the sun, then the next era of human
      existence will have begun in earnest. The era of superhumans and
      superhuman tech as in our movies.
    </p>
    <p>That Bitcoin is, is a wonder.</p>
    <p>Long live.</p>
