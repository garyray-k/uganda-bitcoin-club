      Bitcoin, Climate Change and The Unstoppable Rise of Consumerist Culture
    </h1>
    <h3>by Maali Marvin</h3>
    <p>
      One of the profoundly zeitgeist ideas of our time is the one of climate
      change. It is even claimed that climate change is the major force behind
      massive poverty and inequality as it is creating extreme weather events
      that lead to more periods of famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Climate change postulates that the levels of carbon (carbon dioxide,
      carbon monoxide, methane, etc) in the atmosphere are getting out of hand.
      Why? We are consuming hydrocarbons faster than we are planting AND can
      plant trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary concern is increased planetary heating via the greenhouse
      effect. More carbon compounds means more of the sun’s heat gets trapped in
      the atmosphere. This heat energy then cycles around in the form of winds
      that lead to arid conditions, heat waves, destructive strong winds and
      extreme rainstorms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondary concerns include pollution of the air making it unfit for
      breathing (e.g. from carbon particles due to poorly burnt hydrocarbons).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Bitcoin being a proof of work system that uses exponentially more
      energy the larger its network grows means it gets a considerable bad rap
      from the climate change activists. As far as they are concerned, it is a
      thing of evil. So the question is, should we take their advice and “cut
      back”?
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly, the sentiment is well placed. In a way, agitating for cutting
      back is exhibiting a low time preference. They know they will only afford
      to live modestly but hope their grandchildren will inherit a more peaceful
      world with plenty of resources in plenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on closer inspection, they are a little misguided. Cutting back is
      against the idea of making life easier. Which is what we all want. If
      anybody wants a harder life they can always go live in the Sahara Desert
      or take a hike in a nearby forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bottom line, only those into asceticism will cut back. The rest of us want
      to have fun and live. We want to make money so we can buy the life we
      want. At least, to the best of what the markets have to offer. And boy do
      they have things to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Forget the bullshit, love and happiness can be bought with money. Not
      directly, that would be silly. But money will buy you and your love-to-be
      a dinner date. Then another dinner date. Then it will buy you a nice
      vacation on the beach so you have more time to get to know each other.
      After a few months, you bet you will be deeply in love. And you will enjoy
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One main reason why love is sour in these times is monetary. You kiss and
      you think of all the food you just bought on credit. Then you think of all
      the broke-ass gold diggers you have crossed paths with. Kills the mood big
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, no, the consumerist culture is well established. Especially, if one
      has learnt to ignore the noise in the market and go straight to the
      quality stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consumerist culture is a global culture. It does not know the black
      man from the white man, the African from the European from the Indian. If
      I want to consume food right now and you prefer to consume a Korean TV
      drama, no harm no foul. In fact, all these culture wars are born of
      ignorance of how to properly consume. Ignorance of the way forward as we
      negotiate these murky waters of culture is usually our enemy, not other
      people’s cultural norms.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how to learn to consume can be discovered by accepting first the need
      to consume. Else you are working backwards. Passing your dirty feet
      through the path you have already cleaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you have this Bitcoin thing and with it, everybody can chase around
      the same 21 million digital thingys while doing absolutely whatever they
      want. The best goods win. Sounds fair? I think it does. One, it organises
      all global labour under 1 monetary system without need of a leader hence
      massive efficiency gains. Something previously impossible in every
      monetary system of before.
    </p>
    <p>Next, it is deflationary. Hallelujah!</p>
    <p>
      When Climate Change threatens Bitcoin and plummets its value, everybody
      will rise up to fight it. Doesn’t matter if they sell cabbage, herbal
      medicine, mirrors or slippers. They will band together to fight the
      climate monster. And we will win. We have Uranium.
    </p>
    <p>
      How about if cultural values are threatened by immigrants who have their
      own ideas of what glues society together? We can have the best cultural
      values being the most effective ones at that time and flowing along with
      it, as happens often today in business. The culture of wearing a dark suit
      seems to put everyone in a sharp frame of mind hence its widespread
      acceptance in most business dealings. You too can name instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not recommend that we chase the money at the peril of cultural
      values, but this battle will many a time be fought in the favour of money.
      So that culture either evolves or those people lag behind. You don’t want
      to lag behind.
    </p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p>
      The deal is, Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea. And anything very new and
      exciting is usually scary, not to mention the challenges of adapting.
      Though it may look like there is too much hyping of Bitcoin this is no
      case of counting one’s chickens. These eggs can’t break. By all means, do
      your own homework and see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Climate Change will climate change. This is a big planet and sometimes
      there is little tiny little humans can do on their own to change its
      manners if it wants to go haywire. It would be like trying to stop winter
      by burning papers. Best thing to do is buy blankets, stock food and money,
      and wait the damned winter out. Stopping fighting your neighbours and
      cuddle.
    </p>
    <p>Yes I’m talking of these governments at war. After a pandemic.</p>
    <p>
      All we can do is ethically chase profits, fight negative externalities we
      can handle and have brave governments (choose politicians wisely ya’ll)
      declare publicly those negative externalities we cannot handle (if you can
      handle it you raise your hand) so as to give people a choice. Either get
      on with the program as it reduces poverty, or take camp in the forest or
      the Sahara Desert Mr. Tough Guy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And let’s talk about money. Sound Money = Bitcoin and it is only a matter
      of time before Warren Buffet and All Governments catch on. Can’t blame
      them. We all fear changes.
