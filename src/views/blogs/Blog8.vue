    <h1>Miniaturized Nuclear Energy by Maali Marvin</h1>
    <p>Knock Knock.</p>
    <p>“Go open the door J”,</p>
    <p>Satoshi tells his little boy. Eyes glued to the TV screen.</p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is falling. Falling falling … protests on the streets continue. A
      man cannot live in peace even now. It is chaos. The guests come in.
    </p>
    <p>“Satoshi!”</p>
    <p>“Daniel”. “Peter”.</p>
    <p>He shares out some bro hugs.</p>
    <p>“And who is this with you?”, he goes to meet the stranger.</p>
    <p>“The Nuclear Scientist” adds Peter. Matter of factly.</p>
    <p>“Oh!”</p>
    <p>The Scientist had made it here.</p>
    <p>“What’s your name Mr?” “J-Mbuzi”</p>
    <p>“The goat” adds Daniel. Laughing.</p>
    <p>
      “Kids. Go outside. Right now” he tell his boys. The little one and the not
      so little one. Not so little one grumbles on the way out.
    </p>
    <p>“What was that?”</p>
    <p>“Nothing”.</p>
    <p>“Thought so”.</p>
    <p>Time to play with nuclear material. No kids around.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>“Say what could happen if this thing blew up inside here?”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, it is a very miniaturized reactor, with very good fallout capture
      technology so it wouldn’t do worse beyond 10 square meters. Explosion,
      fallout and all”.
    </p>
    <p>“I’d still be dead, right?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. Very”</p>
    <p>
      “Can I even ask how on earth you energy scientists even managed to make
      this?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can but you will not follow. The info is not in 1 mind anyway. It is
      decentralised”.
    </p>
    <p>"Hmm".</p>
    <p>
      “Satoshi stop dancing around the cookie and eat it already” said Daniel.
      The dirty mouthed one. Dirty mouth but clean hands. If only it was the
      reverse. “Ask him how much juice!”
    </p>
    <p>Satoshi looks at J. La Professor.</p>
    <p>“Well?”.</p>
    <p>J steadies his glasses, “10MW for the next 10 years at least!”</p>
    <p>Satoshi smiles.</p>
    <p>The Star Wars future had arrived.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, there would be no Wars yet.</p>
    <p>Only cool shit.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>
      Energy has always been the cornerstone of progress. Society advances on
      all fronts if everyone has control over the new superpower energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If only a few have the power, then it advances asymmetrically with lots of
      slavish dynamics at play.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich can get richer if the rich control the energy while the poor get
      poorer.
    </p>
    <p>If everyone has a say on the energy, everybody gets richer.</p>
    <p>
      Doesn’t matter much how good a currency idea like Bitcoin is RN. They who
      control the energy used by society control everything.
    </p>
    <p>Here is a story.</p>
    <p>Before the agricultural revolution, mankind invented fire.</p>
    <p>
      And I can honestly say unless the Chief of the hunter gatherer band gave
      you permission to light the match, you did so at your own peril.
    </p>
    <p>Next, picture the agricultural revolution. Here, energy was food.</p>
    <p>
      The most economically unequal societies were structured in a way that the
      King, Pharaoh, Emperor controlled the food. In fact, food was even money
      so taxing food production was truly a big deal. (At least one could
      actually eat that money).
    </p>
    <p>
      Claiming you had a poor yield so maybe you could have a ka tax cut would
      earn you a merciless beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      When metal money was invented, the state controlled the money but they
      also controlled the dammed rivers whose flowing water powered windmills
      which ground corn, which provided “piped water” via aqueducts, irrigated
      fields, and so much more.
    </p>
    <p>Call it fire bottled in the kinetic energy of water molecules.</p>
    <p>
      Certainly, we cannot forget trees. Forests were and still are mostly the
      property of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      There to provide a source of cheap energy for forging coins, tools and
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When fossil fuels were discovered, private enterprise was allowed to
      manage them but government has the final word.
    </p>
    <p>That was one side of the coin.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s flip it on its head so we see the smiles on the people’s faces
      instead of the glum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunter gathers lighting a fire. The excitement in their eyes. The young
      man gives his girlfriend one of the first pieces of human-fried chicken
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the agricultural revolution happens and the society is one where they
      have no feudal ruler lord-ing his political power over them.
    </p>
    <p>The harvest this year has been incredibly plentiful.</p>
    <p>
      There will be much more time now to make merry and be grateful for these
      their gardens of Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trees can be burnt to provide heat in the Winter for all and to protect
      from wild animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chiefs are generous and let people own gardens, trees, whatever they want
      as long as they are not greedy themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money, however it was invented, is good and leads to focussed economic
      planning which leads to efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>Efficiency = More fun with less stuff.</p>
    <p>
      Fossil fuels come on the scene and wonderful industrial revolution
      announces its arrival with the loud whistles and whoosh of a steam engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas, inflationary economics hits hard and people do not understand why?
    </p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“Why what?”</p>
    <p>
      “Why did they not understand that only deflationary economics makes
      sense?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because it was convenient. They were suffering from confirmation bias,
      bandwagon effect, et cetera. Name them”
    </p>
    <p>The students note down in their books.</p>
    <p>
      “But the anarchist scientists selling portable nuclear reactors on the
      dark market. What if they blow up the planet all in the name of liberty
      and abundance of economic opportunity for each one?”
    </p>
    <p>“It is time”.</p>
    <p>“How do you know?”</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t but anyway, can’t be stopped now. Either we tame the fire or we
      burn”.
    </p>
    <p>See, here is the thing.</p>
    <p>
      After inflation bites down hard on every type of paycheck, the credit
      bubble will burst and everybody was ruined. I mean everybody. Even Bill
      Gates and his cows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if it is anticipated. It is like a world war, the imagination of it
      and the reality of it are two very different things.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when time to reset the game comes, it is one thing to have the
      money as Bitcoin and another thing to put nuclear power in the hands of
      anybody with a few bucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our own interests, it will require something I’ll hereby call the
      “careful-handling-factor (CHF)” to go way up.
    </p>
    <p>Let’s make it a 0 – 10 scale.</p>
    <p>A CHF below 5 is a disaster and CHF above 5 is a magical superpower.</p>
    <p>
      Indeed, my CHF is similar to many a scale invented elsewhere for
      controlling AI within the bounds of ethical business practices, handling
      foreign relations via game theory, etc. Except mine is for how well the
      average person can handle extremely dangerous material like nuclear energy
      on their own
    </p>
    <p>
      When it comes to fire, the average adult human is somewhere at 8 or 9.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fires are pretty easy to handle coz when they get out of hand, it is a
      matter of cutting of the oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nuclear reaction can go on in a vacuum. So with nuclear energy, we are
      at something like 6 or 7 when a team of highly trained experts handle the
      stuff in a well designed controlled environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a consumer reactor with a 10MW output in your kitchen is more than
      the best nuclear expert today can handle on their own. Not to mention a
      fictional character called Satoshi.
    </p>
    <p>----</p>
    <p>
      But the meat of the narrative is not in the nuclear energy. Not at all. It
      is in the story of J-Mbuzi.
    </p>
    <p>
      How on Earth could he have been part of the ingenuity that designed,
      evaded capture and delivered a portable nuclear reactor at the doorstep of
      a customer?
    </p>
    <p>
      That my Satoshi will likely be caught or will bug up if the story is to
      have any smarts, is beside the point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point is these long suffering scientists. Like Satoshi Nakamoto, the
      GOAT. Passing down arcane knowledge over years because of a hope for a
      better world stronger than the forces that stop them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is one thing to pull of an Albert Einstein. Come up with some popular
      new age Physics on the structure of the universe.
    </p>
    <p>It is all good and dandy.</p>
    <p>
      It is another to work on forgotten or even unsound ideas for years, over
      many lifetimes, which will eventually make everyone have magic in their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Bitcoin. This is Energy economics. This is projects like ITER.
    </p>
    <p>God bless the hustles of those aiming at really changing the world.</p>
