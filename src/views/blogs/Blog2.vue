    <p>
      Since the inception of the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin
      has been utilized as a tool to balance the financial system. It was the
      first cryptocurrency that ever existed before the creation and adoption of
      alt-coins.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to have existed. Over the years, it
      has become the most notable means of exchange and a reliable store of
      value as a well-known rival to the traditional legacy system finance.
      There has been so much backlash and irreverence from the latter and those
      locked into a fiat-based structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since its debut in 2009, Bitcoin was created to strike a balance in the
      financial system during an economic crisis. The revolutionary peer-to-peer
      system of Bitcoin’s intention as a means of transaction without requiring
      any intermediaries is a global phenomenon recorded on the blockchain and
      verified by nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of its existence and creation thus stands for social equality and
      justice. Bitcoin has liberated individuals, but it has also liberated
      countries and states going down the path of financial insolvency and
      inflation. With just 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, Bitcoin
      features inclusion, accessibility, equality, participation, and rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s diversity in the adoption of Bitcoin, and it’s not limited to
      race, class, and preferred sexual orientation; everyone has equal rights
      of access rights to participation. The overall adoption of Bitcoin
      continues to fight an uphill battle in tackling the patrimony of
      marginalization and oppression in all communities. We have seen instances
      where Bitcoin served as a tool for social justice; the cryptocurrency
      movement bolstered social justice during the #EndSARS protest in Nigeria
      and the TruckDrivers protest in Canada.
    </p>
    <p>
      It served social justice during the #EndSars protest when banks, induced
      by the government, targeted and restricted access to the accounts of the
      lead Nigerian protesters and those supporting to keep the fire of protests
      going. Bitcoin exchanges played a pivotal role when there was a need for
      funding the protests and detours to put restrictions in place.

      Bitcoin is the universe’s escape hatch from financial seclusion and
      inferiority. Thus, for the steady adoption and FOMO elimination amongst
      those who see it as a form of the existing legacy financial system or
      those who see it otherwise as an unstable investment. Orange pilling
      individuals, young, rich, poor, and old, has to be done steadily and
      spread like wildfire to serve its purpose.
