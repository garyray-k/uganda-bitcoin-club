    <h1>Kings of Bitcoin by Maali Marvin</h1>
    <p>
      Whales are people who own so much Bitcoin their activity online can
      significantly affect the valuation of the coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      You know, like if a whale jumped into a waterbody (splash!), the ripples
      would be big enough to affect millions of small fish all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ups and downs of the waves would send the price dancing like Chris
      Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael Saylor is one of those famous whales. He owns about 150k Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>Given a limited supply of 21 million, this is about 0.5%.</p>
    <p>
      At current pricing of $21,000 per Bitcoin (which is a historic low),
      Saylor is thus valued in excess of $3 billion dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assume Bitcoin goes to $100k before say the next 4 years are through.
      Saylor will thus have $30 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>If it goes any higher, and so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>So the average pleb owning sats like me might feel deflated.</p>
    <p>Power is still accumulating in a few hands...</p>
    <p>But is it.</p>
    <p>
      First things first. Saylor can not increase his stock of Bitcoin without
      puchasing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      E.g. like the Emperors and Kings of old who raided villages or the
      Presidents of today who raid drug cartel "banks", he cannot just carry out
      raids and take some more Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>As you must know by now, if you own your keys, you own your Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>
      Yet to find out how exactly the Silk road guys lost their Bitcoin but my
      bet is they left it on the exchange.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly,</p>
    <p>
      To purchase more Bitcoin, Saylor cannot do it with his current stock of
      Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if Bitcoin rose in value say by 10x, then it would be 10x everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p>
      Thirdly is that unlike the capitalists of today who can raise capital
      through issuing of stocks for fiat money that Central Banks can issue
      through unlimited credit, Bitcoin has no such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      To raise capital is a Bitcoin world, whether you are a Bitcoin whale, a
      government or an alien, people have to give you their Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They trust you will do something useful to make the value of the coins
      they still own higher, so that when they get the coins they lent you back,
      there has been a net profit overall in terms of increased purchasing
      power.
    </p>
    <p>Now, Michael Saylor is a human being and a rich one at that.</p>
    <p>He has expensive taste.</p>
    <p>Still assume we were in a totally Bitcoin world.</p>
    <p>
      To buy a nice million-dollars-worth house, Saylor would have to dig into
      his 150k coins. It would not be much of a dent, true, but it would be
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sooner or later, if Saylor is not earning Bitcoin through increasing the
      value of the currency faster than he is consuming his stock, or through
      being given coins by people who like what he does, he will run out.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe not him, but his grandchildren definitely.</p>
    <p>
      This is a truly fundamental shift in the way we see the economic power of
      Kings.
    </p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p>In the past, a King did not have to prove themselves.</p>
    <p>
      Just a word, and they would strike fear into their subjects enough to earn
      free economic power.
    </p>
    <p>
      With their monopoly on violence, their military might did all the talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when money moves into cyberspace and economic power is shifted from
      the military-industrial complex to the information-economic-value complex,
      big-time commando skills and lots of bullets will fall out of favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the world gets more networked, connected and as we play more
      intellectual battles than ever before, the new Kings of Bitcoin will be
      people who know how to inspire people to build great value, people who
      know how to create energy efficiency, educational effectiveness, name it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also the future of government itself. Government officials and
      Corporate Whales will have to provide more value or phase out naturally,
      let in the new kids on the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this future, the queen is the woman who walks amongst her people and
      they do not envy her diamond ring which they have never owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They envy her suave intellect, her graceful way of handling disputes. Her
      wise King who always keeps Bitcoin going up and when he foresees a
      recession, he ensures enough commodities are stocked (from his own coins)
      for society to survive the economic winter without any children dying of
      the cold.
    </p>
    <p>This is the future of money and you and I are the pioneers.</p>
    <p>
      Whether they are remembered or not, in the long chain of causality, when a
      Bitcoin world blooms, plebs of today shall be the foundation stones on
      which it has been built.
    </p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
    <p>
      Let us both stop envying Michael Saylor. Thinking he is unfairly rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      His great work at microstrategy is what makes him great. Not his Bitcoin
      balance.
    </p>
    <p>That is simply a reflection of the man's greatness.</p>
    <p>
      Indeed, in the far future, every man will be as great as his Bitcoin
      balance.
