    <h1>The Proof-of-Work Train</h1>
    <h3>by Maali Marvin</h3>
    <p>Let us look at Bitcoin in a new way.</p>
    <p>Imagine it is train.</p>
    <p>Close your eyes. Imagine it.</p>
    <p>A Magnificient Express.</p>
    <p>Woo Woooooo !!</p>
    <p>
      Emblazoned on it's side are the words “Energy is the ability to do Work”.
      You step forward, grab ahold of the railing and climb abode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as it starts to chug chug out of Newbie Station. Towards grander
      horizons.
    </p>
    <p>You take your seat.</p>
    <p>"Hi"</p>
    <p>Would you look at that. You sat near a girl!</p>
    <p>"Hi".</p>
    <p>She is shy. Thinks she got no business talking to a certified orange.</p>
    <p>"I'm Me".</p>
    <p>"Nice to meet you" she accepts your handshake.</p>
    <p>
      You look out the window and you see them. The terrible storm clouds being
      raised by The Naysayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You feel the foreboarding. Can't jump off the train though, you'll crash
      your body worse than a Terra Luna token.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ghostly and forbidding, you wonder if the train will make it through them.
    </p>
    <p>"Hmm".</p>
    <p>
      "What?" the girl still has her eyes on you. She almost worships you with
      those eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's like she is searching for something. Searching for a sign of silly
      boyishness and not the manly manliness she sees.
    </p>
    <p>"Let me come back".</p>
    <p>You go to the front of the train.</p>
    <p>To the engine room. The MV (Miner - Verifier) carriage.</p>
    <p>You go in. You have to be sure the train will make it.</p>
    <p>
      The heat in here is incredible. And the noise. People are arguing about
      block sizes and Segwit and ESG. Basically a hot marketplace of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>All the engineers (Miners and Verifiers) are standing.</p>
    <p>Your buddy comes along.</p>
    <p>"HEY MAN!" he shouts over the din</p>
    <p>"DUDE!" You shout back</p>
    <p>
      "Welcome welcome". he seemingly mumbles and he leads you to a quite corner
      where you can hash all this stuff out.
    </p>
    <p>"Hey, you seen the clouds??"</p>
    <p>"Yeah. He replies". Slightly worried but he smiles it off.</p>
    <p>"Well, will the train make it?"</p>
    <p>"I have no idea".</p>
    <p>You look at him. Why is he so calm. He has you baffled.</p>
    <p>"Are you having a good time?".</p>
    <p>"Yeah".</p>
    <p>
      "No like seriously, are you? Coz this is the coolest ride ever invented
      yet. I mean look at this thing!
    </p>
    <p>It is fantastic!"</p>
    <p>Guy knows how to get you going. Man you love this guy.</p>
    <p>
      You imagine the scene in the Engine room. Again. And you realize,
      everywhere is the Engine room. Even You, where you are now, your work
      powers the train.
    </p>
    <p>That was the Main engine room but the whole thing is an Engine!!</p>
    <p>You are all riding on a pure engine.</p>
    <p>You all matter.</p>
    <p>
      "Why did you call that place the Miners and Verifiers room the Engine
      room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aaagh. We are just in the lead coz we got lucky but all your work inside
      this train powers it. Actually does more than we could ever pretend to
      do".
    </p>
    <p>You nod.</p>
    <p>
      The fact that this place is Honestly Exciting because of the Opportunities
      it keeps unfolding, you realize, is why millions of people keep climbing
      aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it has space for them all. Comfy space on its rollercoaster journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right Now, it spins as much fun as learning the words of an alphabet. But
      soon, the grand story of the hero's journey nears.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh Yeah". You smile.</p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Minutes later.</p>
    <p>Emboldened.</p>
    <p>You are back to your seat.</p>
    <p>
      The Naysayers, you realize, ain't going to do nothing about your work.
    </p>
    <p>
      For here you are, putting in that work and protecting it with an energetic
      asset. Backing it up.
    </p>
    <p>Proofing it over and over again.</p>
    <p>Over and over and ...</p>
    <p>"What are you thinking?" She asks.</p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking", you reply, getting closer, "that it is really going to
      rain bulls and bears".
    </p>
    <p>She is breathing faster, desire in her eyes. "SO?"</p>
    <p>
      "So", you respond while laying back in your seat. "It is going to get
      really cold".
    </p>
    <p>She raises her eyebrows.</p>
    <p>"Well, it's a good thing we got each other" she winks.</p>
    <p>Your heart jumps. Jesus.</p>
    <p>You're so going to love this Proof of Work train.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      We zoom out and up, and as we do so, we can see that around the train is a
      sort of invisible shield.
    </p>
    <p>Outside the shield, the storm clouds aren't clouds at all.</p>
    <p>
      They are all sorts of bombs, bullets, knives, cats and dogs being thrown
      at it. All sorts of dark spells from dark wizards, trying to destroy our
      Dumbledore-Potter-All the Cool Wizards combined train.
    </p>
    <p>I mean all sorts of killer looking shit.</p>
    <p>But it chugs along. Unscathed.</p>
    <p>
      Strengthened by each hit it survives. And the love that blossoms within.
    </p>
    <p>A benevolent beast on a mission.</p>
    <p>To reach grander horizons for all humankind.</p>
