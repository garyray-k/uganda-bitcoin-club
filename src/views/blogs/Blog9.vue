    <h1>Pleb-onomics- by Maali Marvin</h1>
    <p><strong>Definition of the decade: Deflationary Economics.</strong></p>
    <p>
      An economics whereby the world gets better when the necessities of life
      get cheaper on average. Today, communication (think smartphones) is
      cheaper hence organisation of very complicated value chains is cheaper and
      the only place where we all want to store economic value without a fuss is
      in the money. Not in anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Storing economic value today is ever more expensive because we always have
      to repair the market (it has a leak called inflationary economics) but
      Bitcoin will fix that in a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it is through with fixing these leakages, it will become evident that
      energy is the King resource, so the next revolution (the Energy
      Revolution) will be building the energy structures and systems of a
      magical future. Like in the cartoons and sci-fi movies with awesome
      vehicular spacecraft lying around. Ready to be stolen – borrowed (So
      cool!)
    </p>
    <p>Grand Theft Spacecraft.</p>
    <p>
      As a Bitcoin hodling pleb, it is your duty to hang in there and hodl
      valiantly until by the forces of unstoppable change, we fix the money and
      then fix the world.
    </p>
    <p>To do this well, here are 4 things you could consider.</p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p><strong>Part 1: Accounting.</strong></p>
    <p>
      High school mathematics is more than you need to be a successful
      accountant. If you can add, subtract, divide and multiply two numbers you
      are fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      What those guys do is mostly shake hands and master tomes of rituals on
      how to do their job properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Essentially, it is more like law than mathematics. You have to know the
      correct procedures. This is necessary to keep fakes and pretenders out of
      critical systems, and to keep errors minimal while processing mountain
      loads of data otherwise if you are still confused by double-entry book
      keeping you are going to lose millions of customers’ money.
    </p>
    <p>It has to become second nature and fast.</p>
    <p>
      Accounting is the foundation on which the global financial banking system
      rests. Maybe will be the foundation on which it will always rest, fiat or
      not. I mean, Bitcoin is a ledger. We borrowed the idea from accountants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could we have something beyond accounting? I have no idea of that yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a Bitcoin pleb, the experience of having to secure my own bank vault
      (my Bitcoin wallet) makes me appreciate the reason why Banking is
      something that society is happy to outsource to specialists like
      accountants. You do not have to balance your balance sheet but you need to
      keep secret keys secret and you need to increase your asset portfolio
      (stack sats) faster than your liabilities portfolio (lose sats).
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Part 2: Hodl with fun.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The financial habits of a pleb are simple. Save hard and stack sats. Do
      not get tired of hearing this because when it finally habituates into a
      behavioural autopilot you will be the envy of many.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty with Bitcoin is it will be the #1 thing people are going to
      want to buy when the market is crashing and it is the #1 thing people are
      going to want to buy when the market is performing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because it is the ultimate stock. 21 million of them and that’s all there
      will ever be. If you have seen the &gt;&gt;&gt;infinity/21M&lt;&lt;&lt;
      summary somewhere its coz that person is excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hodler should keep excited. With each sat you buy, imagine it is a
      magical creature that will be here forever. Yours when you own it to serve
      you and fulfil all your wonderful dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we go through these trying times wherever we each may be, hodling plebs
      know they have to sustain the hope of finally benefiting from their
      self-sovereignty enough to withstand mainstream economic shocks without
      flinching.
    </p>
    <p>Fact, as I edit this line, Bitcoin is up 16% and climbing.</p>
    <p>
      Plebs simply want to realise what every self-help book lied was easy to do
      (and erroneously in fiat). Build that golden nest egg that will be awesome
      for themselves and their children. And It will be done. Amen.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><strong>Part 3: Have a worthwhile day job</strong></p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin’s true gains in value happen when there are increases in real
      wealth in the real world. These are in terms of better, more plentiful and
      cheaper commodities (by way of deflationary economics) and in terms of
      better, more plentiful and quality services (by way of prioritization of
      only the best and most valuable things).
    </p>
    <p>
      So a pleb could aim to be a mechanic, doctor, teacher, farmer, builder, et
      cetera who gets their hands dirty with brake fluid, patients’ blood,
      chalk, soil, construction materials handpricks. These are first layer jobs
      that actually make the world a better place from first principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could as well be in the second layer service industry as accountants,
      influencers, politicians, journalists, writers which all involve sweating
      and juggling ideas while off duty. In the name of spending those precious
      minutes of TV time making the guys in the first layer look awesome and
      helping recruit only the worthy to join up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living on day trading one’s Bitcoins is not an ideal career choice and I
      wouldn’t recommend it. Because it is philosophically bankrupt. Ok, ok. If
      done expertly it helps even out the asymmetric shocks of Whales and
      FUDsters that make the market go wild for no good reason to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day trading Bitcoin is an honest job too in this regard. Albeit it is
      usually gambling.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an aim towards whole-being, align with the highest truth and pursue it
      diligently. Gambling, like taking a beer, can be done over the weekend
      just to pass time. And to maybe get the juices flowing with which one can
      confidently start the next week.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Part 4: Learn to code/automate some machine.</p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin coders world over brought us all the wallet apks you know and love
      and now Bitcoin trading via USSD! On a “kabiriki”! Can you believe it or
      what.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is aside from the major league work done building the lightning
      network, multi-sig, mining software, updating Bitcoin’s “O/S” with pretty
      patches here and a bug fix there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theirs is not yet an ideal world in which all dev work empowers machines
      to serve the disenfranchised common man by protecting his wealth,
      connecting him to an abundance of opportunities to do meaningful work for
      others and basically, making the AIs (Artificial intelligences) galore
      work for him more than the bosses that common man works for. But
      everything has to start somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the average dev who earns millions of dollars programming digital
      superpowers e.g. really cool ads for the centralised behemoths of our
      time, a Bitcoin dev is the ambassador of the network who more often than
      not earns less for their services than they put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without these guys, Bitcoin would possibly still be an obscurity little
      know within the confines of the Cypherpunk movement. Because of them,
      Bitcoin will become something everybody can try out for themselves and
      they will see with their own eyes that it is the better deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would’ve had more interest in developing code for Bitcoin if I did not
      already have so much fun building code for quantum computers. But the
      power of quantum computing to use an entanglement of all the qubits to do
      more than a classical bit can imagine, is similar to the power of
      Bitcoin’s decentralization to do more with the fact that nobody needs to
      print any more money and rig the game which is beyond the limits to which
      the imagination of Central Banks can be stretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quantum Computing will solve the science of energy density in battery
      packs, the chaos of climate change and the problems of weak encryption
      technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will directly empower Bitcoin so much as Bitcoin needs to consume a
      lot of energy and sunlight is the future but we’ll need to solve battery
      storage problems. Climate change is caused by sunlight so if we solve
      sunlight energy capture we solve climate change as well. And RSA
      encryption is good but we can improve it by hacking it first to see what
      holds up and what should be discarded.
    </p>
    <p>Maybe multifactor authentication will become common.</p>
    <p>
      Good luck pleb and I hope to see you winning over there, as I do too here.
