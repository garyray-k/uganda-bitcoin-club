    <h1>Pleb-onomics- by Maali Marvin</h1>
    <p>
      Definition of the decade: Deflationary Economics. An economics whereby the
      world gets better when the necessities of life get cheaper on average.
      Today, communication (think smartphones) is cheaper hence organisation of
      very complicated value chains is cheaper and the only place where we all
      want to store economic value without a fuss is in the money. Not in
      anything else. Storing economic value today is ever more expensive because
      we always have to repair the market (it has a leak called inflationary
      economics) but Bitcoin will fix that in a bit. Once it is through with
      fixing these leakages, it will become evident that energy is the King
      resource, so the next revolution (the Energy Revolution) will be building
      the energy structures and systems of a magical future. Like in the
      cartoons and sci-fi movies with awesome vehicular spacecraft lying around.
      Ready to be stolen – borrowed (So cool!) Grand Theft Spacecraft. As a
      Bitcoin hodling pleb, it is your duty to hang in there and hodl valiantly
      until by the forces of unstoppable change, we fix the money and then fix
      the world. To do this well, here are 4 things you could consider. * * *
      Part 1: Accounting. High school mathematics is more than you need to be a
      successful accountant. If you can add, subtract, divide and multiply two
      numbers you are fine. What those guys do is mostly shake hands and master
      tomes of rituals on how to do their job properly. Essentially, it is more
      like law than mathematics. You have to know the correct procedures. This
      is necessary to keep fakes and pretenders out of critical systems, and to
      keep errors minimal while processing mountain loads of data otherwise if
      you are still confused by double-entry book keeping you are going to lose
      millions of customers’ money. It has to become second nature and fast.
      Accounting is the foundation on which the global financial banking system
      rests. Maybe will be the foundation on which it will always rest, fiat or
      not. I mean, Bitcoin is a ledger. We borrowed the idea from accountants.
      Could we have something beyond accounting? I have no idea of that yet. As
      a Bitcoin pleb, the experience of having to secure my own bank vault (my
      Bitcoin wallet) makes me appreciate the reason why Banking is something
      that society is happy to outsource to specialists like accountants. You do
      not have to balance your balance sheet but you need to keep secret keys
      secret and you need to increase your asset portfolio (stack sats) faster
      than your liabilities portfolio (lose sats).
    </p>
    <p>
      Part 2: Hodl with fun. The financial habits of a pleb are simple. Save
      hard and stack sats. Do not get tired of hearing this because when it
      finally habituates into a behavioural autopilot you will be the envy of
      many. The beauty with Bitcoin is it will be the #1 thing people are going
      to want to buy when the market is crashing and it is the #1 thing people
      are going to want to buy when the market is performing. Because it is the
      ultimate stock. 21 million of them and that’s all there will ever be. If
      you have seen the &gt;&gt;&gt;infinity/21M&lt;&lt;&lt; summary somewhere
      its coz that person is excited. A hodler should keep excited. With each
      sat you buy, imagine it is a magical creature that will be here forever.
      Yours when you own it to serve you and fulfil all your wonderful dreams.
      As we go through these trying times wherever we each may be, hodling plebs
      know they have to sustain the hope of finally benefiting from their
      self-sovereignty enough to withstand mainstream economic shocks without
      flinching. Fact, as I edit this line, Bitcoin is up 16% and climbing.
      Plebs simply want to realise what every self-help book lied was easy to do
      (and erroneously in fiat). Build that golden nest egg that will be awesome
      for themselves and their children. And It will be done. Amen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part 3: Have a worthwhile day job Bitcoin’s true gains in value happen
      when there are increases in real wealth in the real world. These are in
      terms of better, more plentiful and cheaper commodities (by way of
      deflationary economics) and in terms of better, more plentiful and quality
      services (by way of prioritization of only the best and most valuable
      things). So a pleb could aim to be a mechanic, doctor, teacher, farmer,
      builder, et cetera who gets their hands dirty with brake fluid, patients’
      blood, chalk, soil, construction materials handpricks. These are first
      layer jobs that actually make the world a better place from first
      principles. They could as well be in the second layer service industry as
      accountants, influencers, politicians, journalists, writers which all
      involve sweating and juggling ideas while off duty. In the name of
      spending those precious minutes of TV time making the guys in the first
      layer look awesome and helping recruit only the worthy to join up. Living
      on day trading one’s Bitcoins is not an ideal career choice and I wouldn’t
      recommend it. Because it is philosophically bankrupt. Ok, ok. If done
      expertly it helps even out the asymmetric shocks of Whales and FUDsters
      that make the market go wild for no good reason to anybody. Day trading
      Bitcoin is an honest job too in this regard. Albeit it is usually
      gambling. As an aim towards whole-being, align with the highest truth and
      pursue it diligently. Gambling, like taking a beer, can be done over the
      weekend just to pass time. And to maybe get the juices flowing with which
      one can confidently start the next week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part 4: Learn to code/automate some machine. Bitcoin coders world over
      brought us all the wallet apks you know and love and now sending and
      receiving Bitcoin via USSD! On a “kabiriti”! Can you believe it or what?
      (Shoutout to @Machankura8333) That is aside from the major league work
      done building the lightning network, multi-sig, mining software, updating
      Bitcoin’s code with pretty patches here and a bug fix there. Theirs is not
      yet an ideal world in which all dev work empowers machines to serve the
      disenfranchised common man by protecting his wealth, connecting him to an
      abundance of opportunities to do meaningful work for others and basically,
      making the AIs (Artificial intelligences) galore work for him more than
      the bosses that common man works for. But everything has to start
      somewhere. Unlike the average dev who earns millions of dollars
      programming digital superpowers e.g. really cool ads for the centralised
      behemoths of our time, a Bitcoin dev is the ambassador of the network who
      more often than not earns less for their services than they put in.
      Without these guys, Bitcoin would possibly still be an obscurity little
      known within the confines of the Cypherpunk movement. Because of them,
      Bitcoin will become something everybody can try out for themselves and
      they will see with their own eyes that it is the better deal. I would’ve
      had more interest in developing code for Bitcoin if I did not already have
      so much fun building code for quantum computers. But the power of quantum
      computing to use an entanglement of all the qubits to do more than a
      classical bit can imagine, is similar to the power of Bitcoin’s
      decentralization to do more with the fact that nobody needs to print any
      more money and rig the game which is beyond the limits to which the
      imagination of Central Banks can be stretched. Quantum Computing will
      solve the science of energy density in battery packs, the chaos of climate
      change and the problems of weak encryption technology. This will directly
      empower Bitcoin so much as Bitcoin needs to consume a lot of energy and
      sunlight is the future but we’ll need to solve battery storage problems.
      Climate change is caused by sunlight so if we solve sunlight energy
      capture, we solve climate change as well. And RSA encryption is good but
      we can improve it by hacking it first to see what holds up and what should
      be discarded. Maybe multifactor authentication will become common. Good
      luck pleb and I hope to see you winning over there, as I do too here.
