    <h1>"Bitcoin is Responsibility-Go-Up Technology" - Svetski</h1>
    <p>
      A few days ago, I googled "Energy Economics" coz Energy runs Civilization
      and before the Wikipedia page had finished loading, I realised. It too
      must have been tainted by inflationary fiat behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I checked. Bingo, it didn't make sense. Not that fiat is to fully blame
      for that (true :) ) but it's little bit of dirt here and little bit of
      value-drain there do add up.
    </p>
    <p>Now I cannot unsee fiat's fakeness.</p>
    <p>
      Then more dots connected - Not just the science of how energy is related
      to economics, but all economic science today has been tainted by fiat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because "high prices of assets are good", economics today is only
      scientific as far as aggregation of human action is concerned so as to
      mehanistically determine profitability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say future AirBnB will always profit from housing because hey, they make a
      listing of all housing out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the price, somebody lives in it. They always make that dough. By
      charging for that insatiable illusion of choice. As if a poor person has
      much of one.
    </p>
    <p>If you have many followers, then you will do Ok.</p>
    <p>
      But this is such nonsense. We cannot all survive on trying to have many
      followers because news flash, that is how to build a ponzi scheme.
    </p>
    <p>So what, we deserve to starve?</p>
    <p>And if the followers starve, who will follow the celebs?</p>
    <p>
      Macroeconomics is easy. Anybody with the ability to count eggs can do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You do not need a high level AI to tell you that millions of followers =
      lots of opportunity to make lots of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      But microeconomics' mainstream theories today - you bet. Pretty nonsense
      from many a highly credentialed Keynesian-apologist Economics textbook.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are better off reading the 4 hour work week. At least it is simply a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>And it is worse but you already know it. So you read it and laugh.</p>
    <p>Boy is Keynesian theory pretty. It sounds so sensible.</p>
    <p>
      Figure this sense - If the prices of say 2 bedroom houses are going up, it
      means more demand for housing which means more people lack housing. The
      lucky ones live in 1 room rentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Same analysis for all assets that put money in your pocket at a
      negative/life worsening expense of the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      How about you get money into your pocket at a positive expanse i.e.
      because you have done something that makes life easier. Like invent a way
      to use fossil fuels so they are cleaner. Hmm?
    </p>
    <p>Maybe I'm too altruist but whatever.</p>
    <p>These realisations made me gloomy.</p>
    <p>Then I smiled.</p>
    <p>Why was I gloomy?</p>
    <p>
      I mean, I have been born in a time when something like Bitcoin is a
      REALITY.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Imagine the mental torture Hayek must have gone through. The poor man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days when he must have thought of a roundabout way but in vain. The
      common man seemed not to have a way out.
    </p>
    <p>Now here it is. And people are learning. And buying sats.</p>
    <p>The Bitcoin responsibility feels like a burden.</p>
    <p>Yes, It is a burden.</p>
    <p>
      One akin to gymming, careering, adulting. Bigger muscle, Bigger creds,
      Bigger mental maturity.
    </p>
    <p>Bitcoin is Bigger Everybody-Can-Actually-Be-Financially-Empowered!</p>
    <p>
      When one gets into the flow, I can imagine few things as rewarding as
      pondering the intricate mechanics of the machinery of Bitcoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mean, I still have no idea what a spot ETF is, or any of the technical
      jargon involving forks but that is Ok. No rush.
    </p>
    <p>This meal is going nowhere.</p>
    <p>I will always adore Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>
      I also have no idea how Bitcoin will peg to sunlight in a positive
      feedback loop (for nuclear energy is not renewable. It can run out.
      Boohoo).
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody has any idea. Not even artistic AIs like DALL-E 2 know what
      something like that (Bitcoin getting into its own) would look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who cares. Here we are with the greatest idea on Earth and it is
      spreading like a wild fire of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon, when I go to a bar or a night club, I will look at the stranger next
      to me and they'll look back. And we shall both be thinking "do you know
      about Bitcoin?". I'll smile and they'll smile back.
    </p>
    <p>Then I'll buy my beer and sip it in bliss.</p>
    <p>
      For Bitcoin is the first way to unite every variable human action towards
      a unified common good(wealth), Without Forcing Anybody To Comply.
    </p>
    <p>I mean, wooow.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Never before have conflicting ideas ever both been tappable except under
      BTC.
    </p>
    <p>
      For under BTC, the strength of the economic predator and the strength of
      the economic prey are both in synergy to improve the economic jungle's
      dynamics and aesthetic of its dance, for all.
    </p>
    <p>Evolutionary economics on steroids is Bitcoin.</p>
    <p>
      It is only a matter of time indeed before everyone is welcomed to a new
      age, to a new age.
