    <h1>Bitcoin is the Key to More of Nature's Secrets</h1>

      Growing up, I watched a lot of spiderman, superman, Asian sci-fi cartoons
      like Code-Lyoko in which a mysterious alien inside a supercomputer
      threatens the world every now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      And sometimes I got so immersed in these films I ran outside and jumped
      up, hoping that maybe I would fly if I believed it enough. Plus, if I just
      aimed for the sky in the right way.
    </p>
    <p>No need for rocket fuel.</p>
    <p>
      Yes, I thought superpowers were unlocked by some nuance other people just
      weren’t destined to unlock except me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I have grown up I believe that this way of thinking, of believing
      there is a secret that Mother Nature is hiding just outside our reach, is
      what drives the tenacious ingenuity that ushered magical technology and
      great ideas into the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a cosmic game of peekaboo, Mother Nature flashes some sort of visual
      of a magical idea but before we fully grasp it, she hides it and reveals
      her oft ugly face again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only by toiling away like mad do we slowly peel away the layers of her
      hidden powers. Sometimes it takes forever, as the ancient Alchemists
      could’ve attested. But if the generations stick it out, eventually, we
      crack open the treasure chest and get to the gold coins.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin is a literal treasure chest. It is a store of wealth. Though this
      time, it cannot be held in our hands. It sort of exists as an incorporeal
      incarnation wrought of electric signals, communicated between
      computational machines in a unique language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entangled with it are all the hopes and dreams of the Bitcoiners. Indeed
      without the Bitcoiners, it would not make sense to talk of Bitcoin. Just
      as money does not exist without a group of people collectively believing
      in its value. Call all humans born post Barter trade Monetarists. Boy does
      a human being believe in the saving grace of m.o.n.e.y.
    </p>
    <p>
      This point may seem trivial because we grow up, from when we are babies,
      dealing with paper (fiat) money and having adults around us dealing and
      bitching about paper money. Hence the reason why we feel an intangible
      thing like Bitcoin is not really money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flip the logic on its head – in a Bitcoin universe – and Bitcoin is money,
      while the people in this universe see our paper money as pretty coloured
      papers with our great ancestors faces. Next to nothing beyond that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other aspect of Bitcoin a key to a grand treasure chest of ideas we
      are still trying to crack open.
    </p>
    <p>Imagine this idea; &gt;&gt;&gt;infinity/21M&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
    <p>That idea is truly wowing.</p>
    <p>
      From the surface, we can see it is tenable. It makes common sense. If
      there can only be 21 million Bitcoin, then everything of value to humanity
      will be packaged in that 21 million.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as this grand idea beckons on the PhD-savvy geniuses among us to help
      bring it into greater physical reality from the obscurity of the
      idea-verse whence it was created, the monetary realities of the world bite
      us like verminous bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inflation forces the hand of Bitcoiners to pull out their wallets, dump
      their coins that were comfortably accruing in storage of
      energy-and-goods-value, for (fiat) paper money so that they can trade with
      the rest of the world in currencies that make sense to the rest of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as we said, the idea in our subconscious that money IS central bank
      printed paper notes, coins, and credit balances is simply sticky and
      pernicious because of the times and because that is how we grew up. But
      money is what a society believes in as a store of liquid value. And the
      harder money wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      If water was scarce then it would be money. And it would be harder than
      Bitcoin on that planet! For there can be no life without water. We’d be
      badass warriors with mental-supercomputers as in Frank Herbert’s Dune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given that we have water in plenty on Earth but there is not enough clean
      energy to make it fresh and plentiful, Energy is sort of the scarcity and
      it being a King Resource makes Bitcoin the only hardest money the Earth
      will ever need.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>***</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      The thing is that everybody alive today beyond the age of 13 was born in a
      world when Bitcoin does not exist. It is really hard to blame them. Us.
      And the fact that we have 13 year olds who were born when Bitcoin had
      finally been invented does not help. Again, their parents, like most
      people, are old fashioned fiat Monetarists descended from a long tradition
      of fiat money and fiat ways of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, once the threshold is reached where the average parent is trading
      more in Bitcoin than in the paper monies of today, then the train of
      progress will switch into gear three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Children will be born and while still babies, will crawl around to listen
      for sounds only to hear things like “…satoshis.”, “…where are the keys
      darling?...”, “This multisig cooperative is going to be great discipline
      for us…”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they’ll go to school and what do you know, their buddies have “kid
      phones” and those phones have games with in-game purchases you can pay for
      in satoshis!
    </p>
    <p>That word again.</p>
    <p>
      Circa 2100, our baby is now the President of the United States. The
      economic pressure is on because of obviously unforeseeable climatic
      events.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a big, sugary green panic button with the word PRINT! emblazoned
      on it. Yes, fiat still exists. Mostly, it is pegged to AI-curated
      propaganda these days. So it works even better than they had 78 years
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief of Staff: “Mr. President. We have no choice. We need the people to
      pinch their Bitcoin and their USDollar Coin and survive this. Food prices
      must be raised so that …”
    </p>
    <p>President: Hush.</p>
    <p>
      He almost presses it. Then he remembers the happiness and courage that
      Bitcoin had brought his childhood. The feeling of living without
      bullshiting nobody.
    </p>
    <p>He doesn’t press it.</p>
    <p>“Better the truth than manipulation, wouldn’t you agree??”</p>
    <p>
      Chief of Staff goes silent. He knows, it is him and the other 1% who will
      now have to cut back. Shit. At least the President will be by their side.
    </p>
    <p>The president turns to the big screen on his left. “Alexa?”</p>
    <p>
      The AI chimes to life. “Well, I’d say we have a 50-50 split Mr.
      President”.
    </p>
    <p>“Ha, I love those odds.</p>
    <p>C’mon, somebody prepare me a press conference”.</p>
    <p>
      The idea in mind involves using the latent energy in Bitcoin mining rigs
      to ride out this new climate thing. He hopes it works.
