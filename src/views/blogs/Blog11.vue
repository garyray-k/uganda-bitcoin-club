    <h1>Bitcoin at $100k</h1>
    <p>
      “What do you think about Bitcoin?” John asked me while he poured my drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, I would have preferred if it was a mythical, sort of conspiracy
      theory?”
    </p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“Then it would have been better respected in the right circles”.</p>
    <p>
      John smiled. He shared my love for tales of mysterious secret societies.
    </p>
    <p>He handed me my drink.</p>
    <p>“But then, it wouldn’t have all the pomp it has now”.</p>
    <p>“And why not”.</p>
    <p>“Too few people would believe in it”.</p>
    <p>I took a sip. Wow.</p>
    <p>
      “I disagree. I think its power depends as much on who believes in it”.
    </p>
    <p>His eyes lit up.</p>
    <p>He always enjoyed when I had something up my sleeve.</p>
    <p>“Enlighten me”.</p>
    <p>I began my marauding. Without the map.</p>
    <p>
      “Well” I started. As I normally do “1 billion peasants owning Bitcoin
      wallets do not seen to me to be behind all this … economic power, than say
      10 billionaires”.
    </p>
    <p>His eyes deflated.</p>
    <p>Disappointment.</p>
    <p>“You haven’t thought it through at all”.</p>
    <p>I paused. I thought it through.</p>
    <p>
      “Fair enough. But there is something to the power of billionaires playing
      crypto games behind closed doors. I can feel it”.
    </p>
    <p>I was pissed off.</p>
    <p>The whisky normally improved my ingenuity.</p>
    <p>John was waiting for me to keep going.</p>
    <p>
      “Look, the Bitcoin peasants trust it too much these days. There has to be
      a gold-rush hiding somewhere close”.
    </p>
    <p>“But seriously, 1 billion peasants…” he added.</p>
    <p>“Are truly something” I finished for him.</p>
    <p>Knock on the door.</p>
    <p>It was Leah.</p>
    <p>“Started without me?”</p>
    <p>
      “You just missed my false start” I offered myself. Before John made fun of
      me.
    </p>
    <p>Leah took my drink and sipped it.</p>
    <p>Wow. She too acknowledged.</p>
    <p>
      “Your angle of billionaires just needs some work Matt. Otherwise mine is
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The government should love this Bitcoin thing to keep going sky high”.
    </p>
    <p>“Why”, whined John.</p>
    <p>
      “So we can steal all that hard earned crypto dough. We have spies
      everywhere, remember?
    </p>
    <p>Especially in our smart phones”.</p>
    <p>I was sober. John looked at her and smiled.</p>
    <p>“You’re a bad girl”.</p>
    <p>“Thank you”.</p>
    <p>We all smiled.</p>
    <p>“Let’s go pitch that plan to the President of the United States”.</p>
    <p>We stood up to go.</p>
    <p>John helped Leah put on her coat. Then she did my tie.</p>
    <p>My idea then fully formed.</p>
    <p>“Before we go, I just realised something”.</p>
    <p>“What is it?” they both wheeled around.</p>
    <p>“The billionaires must already be spying on it?!”</p>
    <p>“You sure?”</p>
    <p>“Yes! That is why it is rocketing up like this!”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, that means the government will be late to the party” John added
      nonchalantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leah froze. What the hell were we going to tell the President of the
      United States now.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>-----</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin had started as an experiment in giving financial freedom to
      individuals without government intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gold-like digital token. Uncopiable, 100% tradeable. Only needs
      electricity and an internet connection to be used as money. And there is
      no boss.
    </p>
    <p>Then people actually believed in it and it boomed.</p>
    <p>
      Then governments found out about it. And minded their business as usual.
    </p>
    <p>Pumping credit and oil.</p>
    <p>
      Then billionaires noticed that more people were noticing it and started
      stacking their wealth in it.
    </p>
    <p>More people found out about that, so they trusted it some more.</p>
    <p>It grew.</p>
    <p>
      We also played our cards all right, but – swallows – seems the
      billionaires are now logging user-data on it.
    </p>
    <p>As we all know, ain’t no billionaire ever kept data on shi…</p>
    <p>“Wait what?”</p>
    <p>“Sorry, Mr. President?”</p>
    <p>“You just said the billionaires are logging user-data on it?”</p>
    <p>“Yessir”</p>
    <p>“Where is the data?”</p>
    <p>“Michael. Open It”</p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of thousands of data files from whodunit servers scrambled for
      space on the massive viewing screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked mostly encrypted as government tax returns, government this,
      that.gov records.
    </p>
    <p>“How much do we have?”</p>
    <p>“A few hundred gigabytes. But this was all from this morning Sir”.</p>
    <p>“Jesus”</p>
    <p>He sat back. This meant only one thing, backlash.</p>
    <p>Loss of control. Loss of the popular vote.</p>
    <p>It could never go out to the media hyenas.</p>
    <p>“Did you call on them before you raided that corporate building?”</p>
    <p>
      “No. We went on a hunch. Lucky, as the data was a few hours from a
      wipeout”.
    </p>
    <p>“This is just the tip of the iceberg” finished CIA Chief AA.</p>
    <p>“Those double crossing bastards! We bailed them out!!”</p>
    <p>
      Usually, billionaires work with governments. However, billionaires
      blackmailing governments by just minding their own greed was too much.
    </p>
    <p>“Do we know who it was?”</p>
    <p>
      “Unfortunately, all traces on these lead back to a cryptographic identity”
    </p>
