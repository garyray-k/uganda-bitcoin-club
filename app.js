Bitcoin has taken this status away from Gold because Bitcoin meets all of the requirements of a good store of value and more. </p><h2 data-v-699f0c9a>What is Bitcoin?</h2><p data-v-699f0c9a> Bitcoin is money on a ledger. Bitcoin, spelled with a “Big B” is the ledger and bitcoin, spelled with a “little b” is the money. What is a ledger? A ledger is a list of transactions that have been made between people that are buying and selling goods from each other. Traditionally, ledgers have always needed a central authority that was responsible for verifying transactions between two people. This system required that people trust the central authority to correctly write down the amounts owed or collected and to not change the ledger for his/her gain. Bitcoin is a ledger that anyone in the world can see. All transactions are not verified by a central authority. Instead, the transactions on the Bitcoin ledger are verified by 1000’s of “nodes” that have individual copies of the entire ledger. If any of the 1000’s of nodes see two parties that are trying to spend bitcoin they don’t have, the nodes will reject that transaction. This is why Bitcoin is a trustless system and why it makes the Bitcoin ledger the most powerful invention ever known to mankind. Bitcoin is a once in a species discovery! </p><h2 data-v-699f0c9a>Why Do We Need Bitcoin?</h2><p data-v-699f0c9a> We need Bitcoin because for 1000’s of years central authorities have always controlled and corrupted money. They have done this by stealing people’s hard work through debasement, known as inflation. Inflation is simply the ability for central authorities to be able to create more money, which dilutes the value of your hard work. Bitcoin cannot be controlled by anyone and is limited to a supply of 21 million bitcoin. This limited supply eliminates the ability for inflation to occur. Inflation is an insidious tax that slowly steals the value of the money you earn from your governments. </p><h2 data-v-699f0c9a>How Do You Buy Bitcoin?</h2><p data-v-699f0c9a> You can simply buy bitcoin on an exchange like Swan Bitcoin or Botmecash which are Bitcoin-only exchanges. Once you buy your bitcoin, it is important that you learn how to self custody it. When you buy bitcoin on an exchange, the bitcoin is not yours because it is held on the exchange. If something bad were to happen to the exchange you are using, you might not have access to your bitcoin forever! </p><h2 data-v-699f0c9a>How Do You Store you bitcoin?</h2><p data-v-699f0c9a> When you are ready to take your bitcoin off an exchange so that you can self-custody, you will have to buy a cold wallet. There are two types of wallets, hot wallets and cold wallets. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and and cold wallet is not connected to the internet. One very important note is that bitcoin IS NOT stored on your cold wallet. Instead, your cold wallet generates and stores your public and private keys. A public key is like an email address that allows anyone to send you bitcoin. The private keys are a series of 12-24 words generated by your cold wallet that give you exclusive rights to your bitcoin. The reason why you want to self custody your bitcoin in a cold wallet is because it is protected from any person on the internet gaining access to your private keys. This is no different than a person storing their gold in a secret chest (cold wallet) that they only know about, versus holding their gold in the bank (exchange), where the bankers can confiscate it. </p><h2 data-v-699f0c9a>Not You Keys, Not your Coin</h2><p data-v-699f0c9a> The common phrase among Bitcoiners, “Not your Keys, Not your Coins,” means that if you don’t have the 12-24 keywords that your cold wallet generates for you, you don’t own your bitcoin. These 12-24 key words are the only way for you to be able to prove ownership of your bitcoin. Store them in a safe place, never share them with anyone, don’t store them on a computer, don’t take pictures of them and never lose them, because if you do, you will forever lose your bitcoin. </p>',17),Pt={class:"blog1"};function Ut(e,t,a,n,i,s){var r=Object(o["B"])("router-link"),d=Object(o["B"])("DisqusSection");return Object(o["v"])(),Object(o["g"])(o["a"],null,[Object(o["h"])("div",Nt,[Object(o["h"])("h5",zt,[Object(o["k"])(r,{to:"/blog"},{default:Object(o["H"])((function(){return[Yt]})),_:1})]),Lt]),Object(o["h"])("div",Pt,[Object(o["k"])(d)])],64)}var Ft={class:"comments","aria-labelledby":"comment"},Gt=Object(o["h"])("h2",{id:"comment"},"Comments",-1);function Rt(e,t,a,n,i,s){var r=Object(o["B"])("Disqus");return Object(o["v"])(),Object(o["g"])("section",Ft,[Gt,Object(o["k"])(r)])}var Jt=Object(o["l"])({name:"DisqusSection"});const Kt=k()(Jt,[["render",Rt]]);var Vt=Kt,Qt=Object(o["l"])({name:"Blog1",components:{DisqusSection:Vt}});a("c1f9");const $t=k()(Qt,[["render",Ut],["__scopeId","data-v-699f0c9a"]]);var Xt=$t,Zt={class:"blog1"},ea={class:"back"},ta=Object(o["j"])("Back"),aa=Object(o["i"])('<h1 data-v-0d040ec2>Bitcoin: A tool for Social Justice</h1><h3 data-v-0d040ec2>by Dele Joseph - May 27, 2022</h3><h5 data-v-0d040ec2><a href="https://satoshisjournal.com/bitcoin-a-tool-for-social-justice/" data-v-0d040ec2> Original Article host on Satoshi&#39;s Journal and shared with permission. </a></h5><p data-v-0d040ec2> Since the inception of the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has been utilized as a tool to balance the financial system.

Over the years, it has become the most notable means of exchange and a reliable store of value as a well-known rival to the traditional legacy system finance. There has been so much backlash and irreverence from the latter and those locked into a fiat-based structure. </p><p data-v-0d040ec2> Since its debut in 2009, Bitcoin was created to strike a balance in the financial system during an economic crisis. The revolutionary peer-to-peer system of Bitcoin’s intention as a means of transaction without requiring any intermediaries is a global phenomenon recorded on the blockchain and verified by nodes. </p><p data-v-0d040ec2> The core of its existence and creation thus stands for social equality and justice. Bitcoin has liberated individuals, but it has also liberated countries and states going down the path of financial insolvency and inflation. With just 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist, Bitcoin features inclusion, accessibility, equality, participation, and rights. </p><p data-v-0d040ec2> There’s diversity in the adoption of Bitcoin, and it’s not limited to race, class, and preferred sexual orientation; everyone has equal rights of access rights to participation. The overall adoption of Bitcoin continues to fight an uphill battle in tackling the patrimony of marginalization and oppression in all communities. We have seen instances where Bitcoin served as a tool for social justice; the cryptocurrency movement bolstered social justice during the #EndSARS protest in Nigeria and the TruckDrivers protest in Canada. </p><p data-v-0d040ec2> It served social justice during the #EndSars protest when banks, induced by the government, targeted and restricted access to the accounts of the lead Nigerian protesters and those supporting to keep the fire of protests going. Bitcoin exchanges played a pivotal role when there was a need for funding the protests and detours to put restrictions in place. </p><p data-v-0d040ec2> It served social justice during the #EndSars protest when banks, induced by the government, targeted and restricted access to the accounts of the lead Nigerian protesters and those supporting to keep the fire of protests going.

Foooo.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Looking closely, we see the man looks haggard with anticipation. Whatever he is boiling seems to be so important his eyes are opened wide in wholesome excitement. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> The dog in the corner is not so sure however. As evidenced by its look of concern over its owner’s health. He never takes a break even to bathe. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> For this time round, he is certain, he has managed to turn some profound mixture of eggs, soil, weird plants and herbs into gold. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Friend, this man is what is called an Alchemist.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Alas, we cannot warn his of his demise. His absolute failure to find the philosopher’s stone in his boilings. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Dying having accomplished nothing like the transmutation he seeks. Like the rest of his fast-getting-extinct kind. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> It is fate that he lives out his life like this. Coz only then shall we have chemistry later on. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>We cannot mess up with the timeline. We can only watch. And learn.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>Why? Why are these men obsessed with gold?</p><p data-v-1f14560a>Well, gold is a very big deal in 1000AD.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>Has been so since 5000 BC and will continue to be so.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> The reason for this is a sweet tale of its own but the short summary is this. Gold is beautifully yellow and indestructible. And independently, all the peoples of the world from the Chinese to Indians to Arabs have seen the light and now use it as money atop of having it as jewellery, cutlery. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>It is the hardest money of the times. And the raddest.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> So the Alchemists in the caves are trying to get rich. They may look like a cross between distraught monks and over-worked coal miners but they are not looking for God in their pots. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Say, they are fuelled by greed.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> In a way, they are like hackers trying to inflate the amount of Bitcoin we have today. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> False tales of increasing the gold supply without physically mining it from the ground, but using ‘magic’, had spread so well that some men devoted their entire lives to doing just this. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> The hype got so big some Alchemists actually are looking for mystical powers alongside gold. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Call them stupid, they invented chemistry. Bless their souls.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> (Wonder what hackers trying to break Bitcoin today will invent. Better decryption tech probably. Which has a lot of real world uses in mathematical problem solving. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>No. They will not create some Bitcoin for themselves).</p><p data-v-1f14560a> The mania for gold became so complete we got to have people called Pirates who hodled gold so hard they buried it in places nobody could find. Hence birthing the wonderful niche industry of treasure hunting. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> And we got this brazen group of murderous explorers called the conquistadors that made the continent of South America known to Europe. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Hence helping make the world a global village. While they killed innocent locals with their deadly guns and European diseases to which only they were immune. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Indeed, sad tales litter the past.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> A story goes that when the Aztec and Mayan peoples asked these men why they loved gold (even the Mayans and Aztecs already knew about gold. Surprised?!) so much they went bonkers over it, they replied honestly that they had this weird disease of the heart that could only be cured by gold. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> All their lives, they had grown up using gold as currency/an investment-by-saving instrument/jewellery whose value and market price and aesthetic value only soared higher and higher. Like an Eagle. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>So much so that it made people live boldly to acquire some gold.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Some crossed oceans on dhows that only depended on seasonal winds to move. Imagine that. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Others wrote epic tales like the story of King Midas.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>Alchemists who believed in witchcraft went and invented chemistry.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> And artists like Michelangelo earned so handsomely they could hang upside down everyday for months, painting wondrous divine images on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Gold was and is so supreme even every Emperor respected eating with golden cutlery, being paid in gold coins (unclipped mind you. Or off goes your head), having golden tables. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Why?</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Because with gold, you could command an army of 10,000 strangers to go look all over the world for the best doctors, engineers, artists and bring them into your service.. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>As long as you are paying in gold.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>--------</p><p data-v-1f14560a>That was the tale of old gold.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>Back to 2022.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>June.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Just so you know, gold is NOT what did things. It was the energy that people, like you and me, used to build, design, think, create a better world. And the energy that we found how to put to good use through heavy-lifting machines and information machines. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> The overflowing love for gold in the past was simply because gold helped everyone achieve economic efficiency by focussing their attention on getting rich in terms of gold. Where before they ran around focussing on hundreds of things they do not care about such as “The price of Chinese herbal tea with respect to a Ugandan lemon” </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Jesus.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>Barter trade was a mess indeed.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> But gold is hard to carry around due its incredible weight and carrying anything consumes energy. Physics 101. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Gold is hard to keep track of to know who owns what in transaction records (Say you are working for the Medici bank in the 1400s. The records could be eaten by rats, you could enter them incorrectly, they could be burnt when Crusader bandits go through your city of Florence). No wonder banks emerged to astounding heights of power. Coz keeping good records of transactions is exhausting and also energy consuming. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> That we live in nations ruled by governments today, if you own gold it can easily be confiscated by the government for the sake of the national good. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Thankfully, a mysterious person called Satoshi Nakamoto created us Bitcoin. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Gold version 2.0</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Unlike the old gold, BTC is easier to keep hidden so thieves will have a hard time stealing it, is easier to move around so much so that you can send some from Europe to South America in a few minutes, and is easier to verify transactions of its really scarce coins that it will only be trusted more and more. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Despite you needing to trust no one on the Bitcoin blockchain except the fact that they also want to get rich. Like you J </p><p data-v-1f14560a> AND – It is built on the energy I just told you about. The thing that actually does anything. The ability to do work as every Physicist knows. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>-----------</p><p data-v-1f14560a> Bitcoin is the beginning of human apotheosis to something truly uniting and empowering to the average Joe. It is a small step to realise the dreams of Adam Smith and Karl Max. Financially empowered good workers who can then use their economic value to create even more economic value. Sidestepping periods of inflationary mania as orchestrated by fiat-ish scammers with sometimes good intentions e.g. “Give me all you money for this fiat token of mine that does blah blah so that I solve climate change for you”. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> With Bitcoin we hope for abundance of goodies and deflation. Instead of artificial scarcity of goodies and inflation. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Even if governments had never gone off the gold standard, Bitcoin was an inevitable invention for a digital world. Like the engine was inevitable once people realised that energy could move things e.g. the lid atop a kettle of boiling water. </p><p data-v-1f14560a>Yes, there is a chance it could fail. Maybe 1%, maybe 0.00000001%.</p><p data-v-1f14560a>It could come from true energy-infrastructure scarcity.</p><p data-v-1f14560a> BUT it will be rediscovered again. Just like the awesome ideas of Aristotle were rediscovered so as to ignite the renaissance in Europe in the Middle Ages. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> It may be named something new as well. Maybe “Mesh-Energy” or something. </p><p data-v-1f14560a> Though once it successfully tethers to the sun, then the next era of human existence will have begun in earnest.

It is even claimed that climate change is the major force behind massive poverty and inequality as it is creating extreme weather events that lead to more periods of famine. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Climate change postulates that the levels of carbon (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, etc) in the atmosphere are getting out of hand. Why? We are consuming hydrocarbons faster than we are planting AND can plant trees. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> The primary concern is increased planetary heating via the greenhouse effect. More carbon compounds means more of the sun’s heat gets trapped in the atmosphere. This heat energy then cycles around in the form of winds that lead to arid conditions, heat waves, destructive strong winds and extreme rainstorms. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Secondary concerns include pollution of the air making it unfit for breathing (e.g. from carbon particles due to poorly burnt hydrocarbons). </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Now Bitcoin being a proof of work system that uses exponentially more energy the larger its network grows means it gets a considerable bad rap from the climate change activists. As far as they are concerned, it is a thing of evil. So the question is, should we take their advice and “cut back”? </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Honestly, the sentiment is well placed. In a way, agitating for cutting back is exhibiting a low time preference. They know they will only afford to live modestly but hope their grandchildren will inherit a more peaceful world with plenty of resources in plenty. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> But on closer inspection, they are a little misguided. Cutting back is against the idea of making life easier. Which is what we all want. If anybody wants a harder life they can always go live in the Sahara Desert or take a hike in a nearby forest. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Bottom line, only those into asceticism will cut back. The rest of us want to have fun and live. We want to make money so we can buy the life we want. At least, to the best of what the markets have to offer. And boy do they have things to offer. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Forget the bullshit, love and happiness can be bought with money. Not directly, that would be silly. But money will buy you and your love-to-be a dinner date. Then another dinner date. Then it will buy you a nice vacation on the beach so you have more time to get to know each other. After a few months, you bet you will be deeply in love. And you will enjoy it. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> One main reason why love is sour in these times is monetary. You kiss and you think of all the food you just bought on credit. Then you think of all the broke-ass gold diggers you have crossed paths with. Kills the mood big time. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> So, no, the consumerist culture is well established. Especially, if one has learnt to ignore the noise in the market and go straight to the quality stuff. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> The consumerist culture is a global culture. It does not know the black man from the white man, the African from the European from the Indian. If I want to consume food right now and you prefer to consume a Korean TV drama, no harm no foul. In fact, all these culture wars are born of ignorance of how to properly consume. Ignorance of the way forward as we negotiate these murky waters of culture is usually our enemy, not other people’s cultural norms. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> But how to learn to consume can be discovered by accepting first the need to consume. Else you are working backwards. Passing your dirty feet through the path you have already cleaned. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Now you have this Bitcoin thing and with it, everybody can chase around the same 21 million digital thingys while doing absolutely whatever they want. The best goods win. Sounds fair? I think it does. One, it organises all global labour under 1 monetary system without need of a leader hence massive efficiency gains. Something previously impossible in every monetary system of before. </p><p data-v-7e51a556>Next, it is deflationary. Hallelujah!</p><p data-v-7e51a556> When Climate Change threatens Bitcoin and plummets its value, everybody will rise up to fight it. Doesn’t matter if they sell cabbage, herbal medicine, mirrors or slippers. They will band together to fight the climate monster. And we will win. We have Uranium. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> How about if cultural values are threatened by immigrants who have their own ideas of what glues society together? We can have the best cultural values being the most effective ones at that time and flowing along with it, as happens often today in business. The culture of wearing a dark suit seems to put everyone in a sharp frame of mind hence its widespread acceptance in most business dealings. You too can name instances. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> I will not recommend that we chase the money at the peril of cultural values, but this battle will many a time be fought in the favour of money. So that culture either evolves or those people lag behind. You don’t want to lag behind. </p><p data-v-7e51a556>* * *</p><p data-v-7e51a556> The deal is, Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea. And anything very new and exciting is usually scary, not to mention the challenges of adapting. Though it may look like there is too much hyping of Bitcoin this is no case of counting one’s chickens. These eggs can’t break. By all means, do your own homework and see. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> Climate Change will climate change. This is a big planet and sometimes there is little tiny little humans can do on their own to change its manners if it wants to go haywire. It would be like trying to stop winter by burning papers. Best thing to do is buy blankets, stock food and money, and wait the damned winter out. Stopping fighting your neighbours and cuddle. </p><p data-v-7e51a556>Yes I’m talking of these governments at war. After a pandemic.</p><p data-v-7e51a556> All we can do is ethically chase profits, fight negative externalities we can handle and have brave governments (choose politicians wisely ya’ll) declare publicly those negative externalities we cannot handle (if you can handle it you raise your hand) so as to give people a choice. Either get on with the program as it reduces poverty, or take camp in the forest or the Sahara Desert Mr. Tough Guy. </p><p data-v-7e51a556> And let’s talk about money. Sound Money = Bitcoin and it is only a matter of time before Warren Buffet and All Governments catch on. Can’t blame them.

Here, energy was food.</p><p data-v-0a835352> The most economically unequal societies were structured in a way that the King, Pharaoh, Emperor controlled the food. In fact, food was even money so taxing food production was truly a big deal. (At least one could actually eat that money). </p><p data-v-0a835352> Claiming you had a poor yield so maybe you could have a ka tax cut would earn you a merciless beating. </p><p data-v-0a835352> When metal money was invented, the state controlled the money but they also controlled the dammed rivers whose flowing water powered windmills which ground corn, which provided “piped water” via aqueducts, irrigated fields, and so much more. </p><p data-v-0a835352>Call it fire bottled in the kinetic energy of water molecules.</p><p data-v-0a835352> Certainly, we cannot forget trees.

Today, communication (think smartphones) is cheaper hence organisation of very complicated value chains is cheaper and the only place where we all want to store economic value without a fuss is in the money. Not in anything else. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Storing economic value today is ever more expensive because we always have to repair the market (it has a leak called inflationary economics) but Bitcoin will fix that in a bit. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Once it is through with fixing these leakages, it will become evident that energy is the King resource, so the next revolution (the Energy Revolution) will be building the energy structures and systems of a magical future.

Ready to be stolen – borrowed (So cool!) </p><p data-v-7da6cd10>Grand Theft Spacecraft.</p><p data-v-7da6cd10> As a Bitcoin hodling pleb, it is your duty to hang in there and hodl valiantly until by the forces of unstoppable change, we fix the money and then fix the world. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10>To do this well, here are 4 things you could consider.</p><p data-v-7da6cd10>* * *</p><p data-v-7da6cd10><strong data-v-7da6cd10>Part 1: Accounting.</strong></p><p data-v-7da6cd10> High school mathematics is more than you need to be a successful accountant. If you can add, subtract, divide and multiply two numbers you are fine. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> What those guys do is mostly shake hands and master tomes of rituals on how to do their job properly. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Essentially, it is more like law than mathematics. You have to know the correct procedures. This is necessary to keep fakes and pretenders out of critical systems, and to keep errors minimal while processing mountain loads of data otherwise if you are still confused by double-entry book keeping you are going to lose millions of customers’ money. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10>It has to become second nature and fast.</p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Accounting is the foundation on which the global financial banking system rests. Maybe will be the foundation on which it will always rest, fiat or not. I mean, Bitcoin is a ledger. We borrowed the idea from accountants. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Could we have something beyond accounting? I have no idea of that yet. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> As a Bitcoin pleb, the experience of having to secure my own bank vault (my Bitcoin wallet) makes me appreciate the reason why Banking is something that society is happy to outsource to specialists like accountants. You do not have to balance your balance sheet but you need to keep secret keys secret and you need to increase your asset portfolio (stack sats) faster than your liabilities portfolio (lose sats). </p><p data-v-7da6cd10></p><p data-v-7da6cd10><strong data-v-7da6cd10>Part 2: Hodl with fun.</strong></p><p data-v-7da6cd10> The financial habits of a pleb are simple. Save hard and stack sats. Do not get tired of hearing this because when it finally habituates into a behavioural autopilot you will be the envy of many. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> The beauty with Bitcoin is it will be the #1 thing people are going to want to buy when the market is crashing and it is the #1 thing people are going to want to buy when the market is performing. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Because it is the ultimate stock. 21 million of them and that’s all there will ever be. If you have seen the &gt;&gt;&gt;infinity/21M&lt;&lt;&lt; summary somewhere its coz that person is excited. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> A hodler should keep excited. With each sat you buy, imagine it is a magical creature that will be here forever. Yours when you own it to serve you and fulfil all your wonderful dreams. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> As we go through these trying times wherever we each may be, hodling plebs know they have to sustain the hope of finally benefiting from their self-sovereignty enough to withstand mainstream economic shocks without flinching. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10>Fact, as I edit this line, Bitcoin is up 16% and climbing.</p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Plebs simply want to realise what every self-help book lied was easy to do (and erroneously in fiat). Build that golden nest egg that will be awesome for themselves and their children. And It will be done. Amen. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10></p><p data-v-7da6cd10><strong data-v-7da6cd10>Part 3: Have a worthwhile day job</strong></p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Bitcoin’s true gains in value happen when there are increases in real wealth in the real world. These are in terms of better, more plentiful and cheaper commodities (by way of deflationary economics) and in terms of better, more plentiful and quality services (by way of prioritization of only the best and most valuable things). </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> So a pleb could aim to be a mechanic, doctor, teacher, farmer, builder, et cetera who gets their hands dirty with brake fluid, patients’ blood, chalk, soil, construction materials handpricks. These are first layer jobs that actually make the world a better place from first principles. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> They could as well be in the second layer service industry as accountants, influencers, politicians, journalists, writers which all involve sweating and juggling ideas while off duty. In the name of spending those precious minutes of TV time making the guys in the first layer look awesome and helping recruit only the worthy to join up. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Living on day trading one’s Bitcoins is not an ideal career choice and I wouldn’t recommend it. Because it is philosophically bankrupt. Ok, ok. If done expertly it helps even out the asymmetric shocks of Whales and FUDsters that make the market go wild for no good reason to anybody. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Day trading Bitcoin is an honest job too in this regard. Albeit it is usually gambling. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> As an aim towards whole-being, align with the highest truth and pursue it diligently. Gambling, like taking a beer, can be done over the weekend just to pass time. And to maybe get the juices flowing with which one can confidently start the next week. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10></p><p data-v-7da6cd10>Part 4: Learn to code/automate some machine.</p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Bitcoin coders world over brought us all the wallet apks you know and love and now Bitcoin trading via USSD! On a “kabiriki”! Can you believe it or what. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> That is aside from the major league work done building the lightning network, multi-sig, mining software, updating Bitcoin’s “O/S” with pretty patches here and a bug fix there. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Theirs is not yet an ideal world in which all dev work empowers machines to serve the disenfranchised common man by protecting his wealth, connecting him to an abundance of opportunities to do meaningful work for others and basically, making the AIs (Artificial intelligences) galore work for him more than the bosses that common man works for. But everything has to start somewhere. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Unlike the average dev who earns millions of dollars programming digital superpowers e.g. really cool ads for the centralised behemoths of our time, a Bitcoin dev is the ambassador of the network who more often than not earns less for their services than they put in. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Without these guys, Bitcoin would possibly still be an obscurity little know within the confines of the Cypherpunk movement. Because of them, Bitcoin will become something everybody can try out for themselves and they will see with their own eyes that it is the better deal. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> I would’ve had more interest in developing code for Bitcoin if I did not already have so much fun building code for quantum computers. But the power of quantum computing to use an entanglement of all the qubits to do more than a classical bit can imagine, is similar to the power of Bitcoin’s decentralization to do more with the fact that nobody needs to print any more money and rig the game which is beyond the limits to which the imagination of Central Banks can be stretched. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Quantum Computing will solve the science of energy density in battery packs, the chaos of climate change and the problems of weak encryption technology. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10> This will directly empower Bitcoin so much as Bitcoin needs to consume a lot of energy and sunlight is the future but we’ll need to solve battery storage problems. Climate change is caused by sunlight so if we solve sunlight energy capture we solve climate change as well. And RSA encryption is good but we can improve it by hacking it first to see what holds up and what should be discarded. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10>Maybe multifactor authentication will become common.</p><p data-v-7da6cd10> Good luck pleb and I hope to see you winning over there, as I do too here. </p><p data-v-7da6cd10>* * * *</p>",47),uo={class:"blog1"};function fo(e,t,a,n,i,s){var r=Object(o["B"])("router-link"),d=Object(o["B"])("DisqusSection");return Object(o["v"])(),Object(o["g"])(o["a"],null,[Object(o["h"])("div",co,[Object(o["h"])("h5",lo,[Object(o["k"])(r,{to:"/blog"},{default:Object(o["H"])((function(){return[ho]})),_:1})]),po]),Object(o["h"])("div",uo,[Object(o["k"])(d)])],64)}var vo=Object(o["l"])({name:"Blog9",components:{DisqusSection:Vt}});a("f5ea");const bo=k()(vo,[["render",fo],["__scopeId","data-v-7da6cd10"]]);var go=bo,mo={class:"blog1"},yo={class:"back"},wo=Object(o["j"])("Back"),ko=Object(o["i"])("<h1 data-v-58d7d7e8>Monetary Theory on Steroids by Maali Marvin</h1><p data-v-58d7d7e8> Satoshi Nakamoto will be remembered as the greatest economist who ever lived. </p><p data-v-58d7d7e8> A software developer, scientist, game theorist, mathematician, philosopher. </p><p data-v-58d7d7e8>The Magna Economist.</p><p data-v-58d7d7e8> Especially with regard to the impact of his creation, Bitcoin, on Monetary Theory. </p><p data-v-58d7d7e8>Monetary Theory deals with how to manage money in an economy.</p><p data-v-58d7d7e8> Unlike Keynesian Theory that advocates for spurring economic growth by making more people money hungry through widening the gap between the rich and the poor, through printing of risk free credit and giving it to the rich, monetary theory has an alternative idea. </p><p data-v-58d7d7e8>It advocates for controlling the money supply through taxation.</p><p data-v-58d7d7e8> If the economy is not picking up speed, then taxes should be reduced so that people use the excess cash to spend on goods in the market.

And I am yet to see people hate Charitable giving. </p><p data-v-58d7d7e8> What Bitcoin does is it advocates for Monetary Theory while fighting Keynesian theory.

It is a store of wealth. Though this time, it cannot be held in our hands. It sort of exists as an incorporeal incarnation wrought of electric signals, communicated between computational machines in a unique language. </p><p data-v-4bc3bed1> Entangled with it are all the hopes and dreams of the Bitcoiners. Indeed without the Bitcoiners, it would not make sense to talk of Bitcoin. Just as money does not exist without a group of people collectively believing in its value. Call all humans born post Barter trade Monetarists. Boy does a human being believe in the saving grace of m.o.n.e.y. </p><p data-v-4bc3bed1> This point may seem trivial because we grow up, from when we are babies, dealing with paper (fiat) money and having adults around us dealing and bitching about paper money. Hence the reason why we feel an intangible thing like Bitcoin is not really money. </p><p data-v-4bc3bed1> Flip the logic on its head – in a Bitcoin universe – and Bitcoin is money, while the people in this universe see our paper money as pretty coloured papers with our great ancestors faces.

But money is what a society believes in as a store of liquid value. And the harder money wins. </p><p data-v-4bc3bed1> If water was scarce then it would be money. And it would be harder than Bitcoin on that planet! For there can be no life without water. We’d be badass warriors with mental-supercomputers as in Frank Herbert’s Dune. </p><p data-v-4bc3bed1> Given that we have water in plenty on Earth but there is not enough clean energy to make it fresh and plentiful, Energy is sort of the scarcity and it being a King Resource makes Bitcoin the only hardest money the Earth will ever need. </p><p data-v-4bc3bed1></p><p data-v-4bc3bed1>***</p><p data-v-4bc3bed1></p><p data-v-4bc3bed1> The thing is that everybody alive today beyond the age of 13 was born in a world when Bitcoin does not exist. It is really hard to blame them. Us. And the fact that we have 13 year olds who were born when Bitcoin had finally been invented does not help.
